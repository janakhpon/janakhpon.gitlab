## What are Git Hooks?

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) are scripts that you can set up to run at certain events in the Git lifecycle. These events include different stages of a commit, like before a commit (pre-commit) and after a commit (post-commit).

## What is Husky?

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a tool that allows us to run `whatever scripts` we want at Git stages ( pre-commit, post-commit, ...).

### Intro

We are going to use Next.js for this project. And what we want to do is we want to lint&format our codebase using `lint-staged` and `prettier` at `pre-commit stage`. So, to do that we are going to use our [previous project](/posts/prettier-setup) that already has `prettier setup`.

#### Option 1

One for all setup. All we need to do is run this [script](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html) `npx mrm@2 lint-staged` inside our project root directory and it will setup Husky, Prettier and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#configuration).

Let's get started:

```shell
  cd demo
  npx mrm@2 lint-staged
```

And now, when we go to our `demo/` directory again we will see that `the previous script` added `.husky` folder with `pre-commit` inside and our `package.json` will also have new scripts showing up:

```json
// package.json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": "eslint --cache --fix",
    "*.{js,css,md}": "prettier --write"
  }
}
```

Let's check whether our pre-commit hook is working or not by adding some changes to our codebase and commit the changes:

```shell
  > git status
  > git checkout -b your_new_branch_name
  > git add .
  > git commit -m "[message] - your commit messages"
```

And now, if you look( 🕵️ ) at your terminal, you will see that `precommit` hook is working! and if you go check your codebase where you had made changes to, you will see that `Prettier` has already formatted them.

### Option 2 ( Just go with Option 1 already, it is easier!!! 😆)

We are going to set up 'precommit' hook using another boring method 😴. Ok, now let's get started by initializing `husky` inside the demo `dir/` which already has `prettier` setup.

```shell
 npx husky-init && npm install
```

Now we have `.husky` folder inside our `demo directory` with `pre-commit` inside and our `package.json` will also have a new script:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

And since I am using only `pre-commit` I am not going to add (commit-msg, ...., etc) hooks but if you want to have it set up you can read more about it [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) 😉.

Next, let's intall `lint-staged` and create a configuration file named `.lintstagedrc`:

```shell
  npm i -D lint-staged
  touch .lintstagedrc
```

And add some configurations into it.

```json
{
  "pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}": ["prettier --write"],
  "styles/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}": ["prettier --write"]
}
```

And now, we need to go to `.husky/pre-commit` file and replace `npm test` with `npm run pre-commit`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
  . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"
  # npm test
  npm run pre-commit
```

Let's check whether the pre-commit hook is working or not for this set up:

```shell
  > git status
  > git checkout -b your_new_branch_name
  > git add .
  > git commit -m "[message] - your commit messages"
```

Now, if you look at the terminal, you will see that the `pre-commit` hook for this setup is working just like the previous Option 1 too.

Yay!!! Time to celebrate: "Congratulations🎉!, now you have successfully set up pre-commit hook for your Next.js project".
