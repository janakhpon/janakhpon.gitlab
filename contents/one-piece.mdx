## Hello World!

This is just an example blog post!. Since I am a big fan of `One Piece`, I prefer to display review for One Piece as a placeholder instead of `lorem ipsum`.

### Intro

If you are into anime, you should watch One Piece.

```jsx:anime.jsx
import React from 'react';

function Anime() {
  return <h1>ONE PIECE IS AWESOME!!!</h1>
}
```

#### Synopsis

[One Piece](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece): Monkey D. Luffy wants to become the King of all pirates. Along his quest he meets: a skilled swordsman named Roronoa Zolo; Nami, a greedy thief who has a knack for navigation; Usopp, a great liar who has an affinity for inventing; Sanji, a warrior cook; Chopper, a sentient deer who is also a skilled physician; and Robin, former member of Baroque Works. The gang sets sail to unknown seas in Grand Line to find the treasure of One Piece.
